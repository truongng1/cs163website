CPI Rate Cleaning Explanation
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate was compiled from two separate raw data sources, due to the unavailability of a single consistent dataset for San Jose:

This Excel file contains CPI data specific to San Jose from 2015 through 2024.

2013–2015 CPI Rates (Bay Area)
Source: https://storage.googleapis.com/cs163-seniorproject.appspot.com/dataset/cpi_rate/raw_dataset/consumerpriceindex_sanfrancisco_table%20(1).pdf

Because historical CPI data for San Jose (2013–2015) was not available, data from the Bay Area (San Francisco region) was used as a proxy for this time period.

Note: The values for 2013–2015 were manually transcribed from the PDF source to ensure continuity and completeness of the CPI time series.
